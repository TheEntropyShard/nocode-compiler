# No Code Compiler

This is a self-hosted compiler for [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode).

### Quick start
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheEntropyShard/nocode-compiler
cd nocode-compiler
```
and then run
```shell

```
So, you have bootstrapped nocode-compiler. Now you can use it to compile nothing. Lets try to compile an example application from the No Code repository:
```shell

```
As you can see, no errors. Try to run it and you should see exactly the same result:
```shell

```
